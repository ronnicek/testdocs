Is there some more functionality here? 

```powershell
r-H fc a
```
That should have been `Write-Host "fuckin a`. The code block typing is a bit buggy. But it can be written by hand. Maybe it's the browser/keyboard I'm using.

How about from computer. Now I was able to see *All pages*. I like the built in editor that it somehow format the text while you type.  
New line test with the previouse line having double ending spaces.

## Code block test
```powershell
Write-Host "Fuck yeah!"
```

## Tables
1. Something
2. Somthing else
   1. How about this?
