Is there some more functionality here? 

```powershell
r-H fc a

How about from computer. Now I was able to see *All pages*. I like the built in editor that it somehow format the text while you type.  
New line test with the previouse line having double ending spaces.

## Code block test

Write-Host "Fuck yeah!"
```
